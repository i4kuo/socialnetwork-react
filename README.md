# Social Network (React JS)

## Website

## Overview

Social Network - Fullstack project, using React.js, where user can create an account, informations about theirselves, make friends, send message and chat with other users.

## Details

	-	React js framework for making a single page application, using the philosophy of React to render different views as the user profile page, some other others profile pages.
	-	Clear and easy UI experience.
	-	Node js on server-side, using PostgreSQL database.
	

Working on this project help me to consolidate my knowledge about databases (PostgreSQL), server site routes, queries, use of middleware as "body parser" or "multer", but I really learnt a lot about React.


## Personal Word


This is a 10 days project, focusing on the basis of a social network : creating an account, adding friend, and creating chatroom.  really loved this project, I had a pretty good feeling with React JS, and I would love to keep working with React in the future.

<p align="center"><b>I was really proud to work on the next two features : the online page and the chat room. I used the socket.io technology to listen to every connection or disconnection on the website, and to make a reactive and efficient chat room. This is the online page</b></p>

<p align="center"><b> And this is the chat room : on the left, a mobile screen, on the right, a laptop screen, communicating with two different sessions.</b></p>
